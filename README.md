# Creating-a-Pokedex.csv-file-using-Web-Scraping-in-Python
Created a pokedex.csv file from scratch using web-scraping in Python. A thorough data analysis will be conducted on the data in the coming weeks.

Step 1: In the first step I extracted all the Pokedex entries from pokemondb.net. I then realized that they don't include abilities as a part of the table.

Step 2: Hence in step 2, I extracted all the abilities from serebii.net. However, in serebii, the abilities of Hisuian forms were missing and those of mega-evolutions and regional variants were not listed.

Step 3: So, in step 3, I managed to extract all these missing abilities again from pokemondb.net and merged all the data together to make the final Pokedex.csv file.

This is just a sample project that I worked on during my free time as I haven't found a full Pokedex csv file online and thought it would be useful to create one.

I hope you enjoy the file. Please do let me know if you want me to include some other stats in the file. I hope you enjoy the dataset :)

I would also like to acknowledge that I had used loops quite a lot in the script which might take a while to execute and I am working on making the code more efficient. Please let me know if you can find a more efficient way to avoid loops as much as possible and I will try to incorporate it into the script.
